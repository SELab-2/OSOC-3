# Roles

Note that in the column below, `preference` is nothing more than

| Name    | Roles                             | Preference*   |
| :------ | :-------------------------------- | :------------ |
| Bert    | Customer relations                | Backend       |
| Clement | Database management<br />Frontend | Frontend      |
| Francis | System administrator<br />CI/CD   | Backend       |
| Seppe   | API management                    | No preference |
| Stijn   | Project lead                      | Backend       |
| Tiebe   | Documentation                     | Frontend      |
| Ward    | Tests                             | No preference |

*Note that `preference` is not a separation of teams, but rather an indication of what each person likes the most or is most proficient at. Everyone will have to work in multiple fields, and learn new things every now and then.
