# User Manual

In this file, we describe how the selection tool is meant to be used by the end users. This is divided in the different parts of the website.

There are different ways to log in, depending on the way in which you have registered yourself. **Please note: you can only log in through the method you have registered yourself with.**

## Email history of a student

To view a student's email history (i.e. all the emails that have ever been sent to that student), navigate to the page with the student's details, and click on the "See Email History" button.

The email history will be shown in a table, with the most recent email at the top.

## Overview of email states

The overview of the email states is a table of all students of an edition, together with the most recent email type that has been sent to them.

This table needs to be manually maintained (i.e. when an email is sent, someone has to update this list).

### Searching and Filtering

The overview table allows you to search for a particular student or filter based on one or more email states.

To search for a student: type (the beginning of) a student's name in the search bar and click on the "search" button.

To filter based on email states: select one or more states from the list and click on the "search" button.

These two things (searching and filtering) can also be combined.

### Updating the email overview

When a new email is sent to one or more students, the list needs to be updated. 

This can be done by selecting these students in the table, clicking on the "Set state of selected students", and choosing the new email state from the dropdown.
