# Extra info from discussions

- student coach is seen as a role in a project, students can request being a student coach, but this is decided just like other roles in a project
- make sure there is always at least one admin (admin cannot degrade themself)
- admins create projects, coaches cannot do this
- all coaches can **see** all projects, but can only add students to the one they are assigned to
- keep admins for next edition, students and coaches must be specific for one edition
- coaches can have multiple projects
- admins must be able to move a coach to another project, create new projects at any time
- use UI framework like bootstrap
